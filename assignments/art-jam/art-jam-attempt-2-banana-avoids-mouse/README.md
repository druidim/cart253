## Description

This program allows the user to chase a banana with their mouse. Should the user cause the banana too much stress, its ripeness will fluctuate to make it less a-peel-ing.

## Credits

This project uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org).

## Attribution

The movement of the banana and the user were directly copied from the conditionals challenge.

The constrain that keeps the banana on-screen was referenced from the Mr. Furious challenge.

The shape of the banana was made by modifying the handle from the umbrella challenge.

The colour changes of the banana were made while copying / referencing / modifying the "creature loves mouse/massage" and "death by boredom" instructional videos.
